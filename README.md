Right click on the screen and a menu will appear.
The menu contains 6 options which are Clear, Objects, Colors, Point sizes, Line width and Exit.
The clear option basically clears the entire screen, where all the drawn shapes disappear and a blank screen appears.
The Objects option lets you choose from the different shapes like Point, Line, Triangle, Quad and a Polygon.
The Colors option lets you choose the color of the current and the future shapes. The color options are Red, Green, Blue, Black.
The Point Sizes option lets you choose from the different point sizes of 1.0f, 4.0f and 8.0f while drawing a point.
The Line Width option lets you choose from the different line widths of 1.0f, 4.0f and 8.0f while drawing a line.
Lastly, the Exit option enables you to exit the screen.
Also with the help of Enter key, you can exit drawing the current line in case of lines and polygons and start a new shape from the menu.
